# ProPro

ProPro is a project which aims to provide the fastest and most accurate navigation data for free.
The software consists of a two-tier model where front- and backend are completely separated.

In the current implementation, only a prototype of the backend exists while a frontend is not implemented yet.

The backend parses prebuilt .fmi files and builds an efficient data structure to be able to find the most efficient path even with a less powerful machine.
The underlaying algorithm is based on a one-to-all Dijkstra path-finding algorithm and tries to find the nearest available node based on the user's current position.

## Techologies used

- Backend built on Java
- Build system implemented in Gradle
- No external dependencies

## Building the software
- Grandle does that
- How to use Gradle you might ask?
- Eclipse does that
- Or does it
- ok bye
